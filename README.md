## Churn_prediction

Churn prediction is a commonly used technique in the field of machine learning. If you're not familiar with the term, churn refers to the act of customers leaving a company. It is crucial for businesses to understand why and when customers are likely to churn. By developing a robust and accurate churn prediction model, businesses can take proactive measures to prevent customers from leaving.

In this particular project, I will be working with the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset, which is available on Kaggle. The dataset consists of information for 7,043 customers and includes 20 independent variables (features) and 1 dependent variable (target). The target variable indicates whether a customer has recently left the company (churn=yes) within the last month. As the target variable has two states (yes/no or 1/0), this becomes a binary classification problem.

The variables present in the dataset are as follows: 'customerID', 'gender', 'SeniorCitizen', 'Partner', 'Dependents', 'tenure', 'PhoneService', 'MultipleLines', 'InternetService', 'OnlineSecurity', 'OnlineBackup', 'DeviceProtection', 'TechSupport', 'StreamingTV', 'StreamingMovies', 'Contract', 'PaperlessBilling', 'PaymentMethod', 'MonthlyCharges', 'TotalCharges', and 'Churn'.
